# Discord join up bot

This is a discord bot that manages new people joining servers run as club collaborative environments.

It checks for member emails and registers members thus known with an appropriate server nickname.

If a person joining cannot be validated as a member in this manner, they are confined to the #Guest channel until
an admin on the server either kicks them or fully admits them.

# Service notes

The service currently runs on qclub.au under the user discord_bot.
